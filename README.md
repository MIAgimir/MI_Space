# MI_SafeSpace
Ox_Lib based script for creating custom zones in your server. I know it may look terribly simple, but I am using this to learn the ox framework and I'm having fun with this. I have set up 3 example locations with entering / leaving notifications for some use and inspiration:
* 1 - A Safe Zone
* 2 - A Restricted Area
* 3 - A Gang Territory
I do intend to build on this and add new features in time, so I hope you stay tuned.

### Dependencies:
* [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)

### Customization:
Reference the documents here for customizing the notifications and zones:
* [notifications](https://overextended.github.io/docs/ox_lib/Interface/Client/notify/#libnotify)
* [zone managment](https://overextended.github.io/docs/ox_lib/Zones/Client)
